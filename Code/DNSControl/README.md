This folder contains the files used to semi-automate the DNS infrastructure of the DN42 network. The files here are used to generate the zone files imported by BIND9, through a process known as Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC). [DNSControl](https://stackexchange.github.io/dnscontrol/) uses JavaScript to (optionally dynamically) generate the DNS RRs to be added, which are then exported either to a zone file or even directly to DNS providers or selfhosted DNS servers like [PowerDNS](https://doc.powerdns.com/). Read more about the DNS setup I used in the [wiki](https://github.com/dannytech/cc-ccc/wiki/DNS).
