This directory holds the minimal code used to set up and administrate the configured DN42 network. The files in the `DNSControl` folder are separately documented, but are used to generate zone files used to serve the domain `champlain.dn42`. The `vyos-commands.txt` holds most of the commands used to prepare the VyOS router to peer (including tasks like configuring DNS, SLAAC, BGP, and the address space allocations), but does not include the commands for actually [peering](https://github.com/dannytech/cc-ccc/wiki/Peering).
